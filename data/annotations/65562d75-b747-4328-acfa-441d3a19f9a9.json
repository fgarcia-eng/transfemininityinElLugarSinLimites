Traditionally, cine de ficheras organizes desire around heterosexual spectacle, humor, and containment: women’s bodies are eroticized for male consumption, often through striptease or partial nudity bordering on soft porn; musical interludes (boleros, rancheras, live cabaret performances) punctuate the narrative; and queer figures appear as comic relief or excessive caricature. Sexuality, however explicit, ultimately serves to reaffirm masculine dominance rather than threaten it."

La Manuela’s centrality breaks decisively from this logic. In queering cine de ficheras, the film shifts the center of gravity from heterosexual male pleasure to transfeminine visibility, vulnerability, and agency. La Manuela is not a peripheral spectacle but the narrative axis around which desire coheres and collapses. Song, dance, and performance cease to function as escapist entertainment; they become the very mechanisms through which gender is negotiated, made legible, and violently punished. The genre’s conventions persist, but they are retooled to stage tragedy rather than release—announcing from the outset that this is a brothel film without redemption, laughter without safety, and spectacle without limits."

What the scene reveals is not liberation, but a fragile, tactical survival within a linguistic economy where being named is inseparable from being exposed."
