Her withdrawal—from public space, from the brothel, from visibility itself—is a strategy shaped by memory of past violence and by the knowledge that Pancho’s masculinity authorizes harm. When he finally forces his way into the brothel, Manuela retreats even further, slipping into the back patio and watching from the shadows as Pancho drinks, dances, and asserts control over the space. Fear here is spatialized: survival depends on remaining unseen."

Her emergence is not a return to safety but an act of interruption—one compelled by care, kinship, and the impossibility of continued invisibility."
