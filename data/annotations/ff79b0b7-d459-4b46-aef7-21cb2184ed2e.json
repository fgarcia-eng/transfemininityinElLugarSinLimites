Her withdrawal—from public space, from the brothel, from visibility itself—is a strategy shaped by memory of past violence and by the knowledge that Pancho’s masculinity authorizes harm. When he finally forces his way into the brothel, Manuela retreats even further, slipping into the back patio and watching from the shadows as Pancho drinks, dances, and asserts control over the space. Fear here is spatialized: survival depends on remaining unseen."

Within the logic of the fiesta, La Manuela momentarily inverts the sex/gender system: transfeminine presence becomes central rather than peripheral, desired rather than disavowed."

What appears here as triumph (she as a she) is also countdown. The spectacle that grants La Manuela centrality simultaneously renders her uncontainable. By forcing recognition, she destabilizes the fragile pact that allows queer desire to circulate only in shadow."
