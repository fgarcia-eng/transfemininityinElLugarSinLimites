Her withdrawal—from public space, from the brothel, from visibility itself—is a strategy shaped by memory of past violence and by the knowledge that Pancho’s masculinity authorizes harm. When he finally forces his way into the brothel, Manuela retreats even further, slipping into the back patio and watching from the shadows as Pancho drinks, dances, and asserts control over the space. Fear here is spatialized: survival depends on remaining unseen."

Pancho’s panic is immediate. His affect hardens into rage, and he moves quickly to reassert control through threat and violence: “Te mato si le dices a alguien que me viste chillando.” The scene exposes masculinity as a performance sustained through surveillance and disavowal.

Darkness overtakes the screen as the chase unfolds through empty streets and open land, stripping away the protective frame of the fiesta. The killing does not resolve Pancho’s crisis; it seals it. La Manuela is eliminated not because she deceived him, but because she revealed him. Her death functions as an act of heteromasculine repair, reasserting a social order destabilized by visible queer desire. The film closes by exposing the cost of that repair: transfeminine life is rendered narratively disposable so that masculinity can appear whole again."
