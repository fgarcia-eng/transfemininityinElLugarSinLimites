The exhibit opens with an introductory essay that situates the film within a broader Mexican genealogy of gender variance, visibility, and violence, drawing on queer theory, trans studies, and intersectional media analysis. The project then brings together a curated set of clips—sourced from YouTube—including pivotal scenes from the film as well as interviews with the director and actors. Users can explore timestamped annotations for each clip that highlight key moments in the film’s construction of gender and desire through close readings of dialogue, lighting, music, performance, and narrative composition. These annotations also incorporate historical context related to nationalism, machismo, nota roja sensationalism, and emerging queer social movements, emphasizing how La Manuela’s visibility is shaped by—and constrained within—broader ideological sex/gender regimes. Through curated tags (thematic clusters) and audiovisual analysis, the project invites viewers to engage the oscillation between spectacle and subjectivity that defines transfeminine representation in Mexican cinema.","language":"en","slug":"transfemininityinElLugarSinLimites","creator":"fgarcia-eng","authors":"","media_player":"avannotate","auto_populate_home_page":true,"additional_users":[],"tags":{"tagGroups":[{"color":"#F7ED78","category":"Sex-Gender System"},{"color":"#ADFEFF","category":"Mexican Cinema"},{"color":"#CBE364","category":"Queer Spaces"},{"color":"#F2A7C3","category":"Transfeminine Identity "}],"tags":[{"category":"Sex-Gender System","tag":"Queer desire in rural contexts"},{"category":"Sex-Gender System","tag":"Trans* embodiment on screen"},{"category":"Mexican Cinema","tag":"Mexican Melodrama"},{"category":"Mexican Cinema","tag":"Cine de ficheras"},{"category":"Sex-Gender System","tag":"Body Politics on the screen"},{"category":"Sex-Gender System","tag":"Queer Masculinity"},{"category":"Mexican Cinema","tag":"Queer body as spectacle"},{"category":"Queer Spaces","tag":"Fiesta as social stage"},{"category":"Queer Spaces","tag":"Rurality and queernes"},{"category":"Transfeminine Identity ","tag":"Trans* embodiment"},{"category":"Mexican Cinema","tag":"Queering the genre"},{"category":"Queer Spaces","tag":"El Olivo"},{"category":"Transfeminine Identity ","tag":"Transness and violence"},{"category":"Transfeminine Identity ","tag":"Feminine self-naming"},{"category":"Transfeminine Identity ","tag":"Sexile "}]},"created_at":"2026-01-07T02:19:35.992Z","updated_at":"2026-01-07T04:38:17.119Z","generate_pages_site":true},"annotations":{},"events":{},"eventOrder":[],"pages":{"685bb484-2cd1-49a3-885e-68f48c386187":{"content":[],"created_at":"2026-01-07T02:19:36.007Z","created_by":"fgarcia-eng","title":"transfemininity-el-lugar-sin-limites","updated_at":"2026-01-07T02:19:36.007Z","updated_by":"fgarcia-eng","autogenerate":{"enabled":true,"type":"home"}}},"pageOrder":["685bb484-2cd1-49a3-885e-68f48c386187"]}
