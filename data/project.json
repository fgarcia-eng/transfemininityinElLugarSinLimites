Annotations will include transcript excerpts, cinematic techniques (shot composition, lighting, sound), intertextual references, and historical context related to 1970s Mexican media, nota roja sensationalism, and emerging queer social movements. I also plan to use tags and categories to highlight recurring tropes of transfeminine representation (e.g., transphobia, masculinity, precarity), and to analyze how visual and narrative structures reinforce or challenge normative gender regimes. AVAnnotate will allow me to break down the film into analyzable segments that foreground its audiovisual construction of gender nonconformity.","language":"en","slug":"transfemininityinElLugarSinLimites","creator":"fgarcia-eng","authors":"","media_player":"avannotate","auto_populate_home_page":true,"additional_users":[],"tags":{"tagGroups":[{"color":"#F7ED78","category":"Sex-Gender System"}],"tags":[{"category":"Sex-Gender System","tag":"Queer body as spectacle"},{"category":"Sex-Gender System","tag":"Queer desire in rural contexts"}]},"created_at":"2026-01-07T02:19:35.992Z","updated_at":"2026-01-07T02:21:33.779Z","generate_pages_site":false},"annotations":{},"events":{},"eventOrder":[],"pages":{"685bb484-2cd1-49a3-885e-68f48c386187":{"content":[],"created_at":"2026-01-07T02:19:36.007Z","created_by":"fgarcia-eng","title":"transfemininity-el-lugar-sin-limites","updated_at":"2026-01-07T02:19:36.007Z","updated_by":"fgarcia-eng","autogenerate":{"enabled":true,"type":"home"}}},"pageOrder":["685bb484-2cd1-49a3-885e-68f48c386187"]}
